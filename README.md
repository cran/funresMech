## Overview

**funresMech** implements the mechanistic, stochastic functional response model proposed by Okuyama (2012) and extended to parasitoids in Okuyama (2026). Unlike traditional approaches that rely on heuristic distributions (binomial or beta-binomial), this package simulates the underlying search-encounter-handling process to generate the probability distribution of the data, providing a more flexible and mechanistically sound framework for functional response analysis.

The package includes:
- An interactive **Shiny application** for data exploration and model fitting.
- **Maximum likelihood estimation** using a simulation-based likelihood.
- **Likelihood profiles** for the density-scaling exponent \\(z\\).
- **Model comparison** via AIC between full (\\(z\\) free) and restricted (\\(z = 1\\)) models.
- **Comprehensive diagnostic plots** including stochastic curves, histograms, density plots, boxplots, violins, and fan plots.

## Installation

### From GitHub (development version)
```r
# Install from GitHub using pak (recommended)
install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("Segon03/funresMech")

# Or using devtools (legacy)
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Segon03/funresMech")
From CRAN (stable version, once published)
r
install.packages("funresMech")
Basic Usage
Launch the Shiny App
r
library(funresMech)
run_app()
This opens the interactive application where you can:

Upload your dataset (CSV format).

Select columns for species, host density, and parasitism.

Configure advanced settings (simulation parameters, optimization options).

Run the analysis and explore results interactively.

Programmatic Usage (Advanced)
r
# Load the package
library(funresMech)

# Prepare your data (example format)
data <- data.frame(
  species = rep("Species_A", 30),
  dens = rep(c(10, 20, 40, 80, 160), each = 6),
  par = c(2, 3, 5, 8, 12, ...)  # Your data
)

# Fit the model (internal functions)
# See package documentation for details
Features
Mechanistic simulation: Search times follow a Gamma distribution; handling times follow a Lognormal distribution.

Stochastic likelihood: The probability distribution of parasitism is generated through repeated simulations.

Flexible density scaling: The exponent \(z\) allows emergence of Type I, II, III-like responses.

Uncertainty quantification: Confidence intervals for \(z\) via profile likelihood.

Interactive visualization: Dynamic plots with plotly for exploring results.

Comprehensive reporting: Generate HTML reports summarizing all analyses.
